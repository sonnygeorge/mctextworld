# mctextworld

`mctextworld` is a Python package that provides semantically intuitive high-level functions for controlling a Minecraft player (bot), effectively turning Minecraft into a text-based game for the purpose of building language based planning algorithms (e.g., using LLMs).

ðŸš§ This project is currently under development! ðŸš§


## Installation

```bash
pip install mctextworld
```

## Usage

```python
from mctextworld import Player, Minecraft

# Launch Minecraft instance
minecraft = Minecraft(headless=False)
# Create/connect to a singleplayer world
player = Player(minecraft, multiplayer_server_ip=None)
# Prints the details of the player's state in natural language
print(player.state)
# Call high-level functions to control the player
player.approach("oak_log")
player.mine("oak_log")
```

## Goals

### Unlocking Game States

We want to build (and document) a set of semantically intuitive set of general functions that can robustly unlock most game states in:

1. **Overworld (Peaceful Mode)** - The immediate goal (very difficult)
2. **Overworld** - A hopeful goal if we can achieve #1 (requires logic that constantly checks for hostile mobs and, interrupting other function/code execution, triggers rule-based combat AI when needed)
3. **Overworld+Nether** - Will essentially require further testing and tweaking in order for functions to be robust for unlocking states/surviving in the (more difficult) nether.
4. **Overworld+Nether+End** - The moonshot goal: implement a minimal set of semantically intuitive general functions that could beat the game (e.g., if used to play the "textworld" game by an intelligent human). 

### Semantically Intuitive General Functions

- **General:** The functions need to be general such that the total number of functions is minimized (whilst still being robust).
- **Semantically intuitive:** We also need them to be semantically intuitive and idiomatic such that an LLM could easily read their (succinct) documentation and have a high chance of understanding how to use them.

### Error Handling

We will need to carefully catch and handle errors in as semantic a way as possible. For example, if the `craft` function is called without a recipe's necessary ingredients, the user/LLM should be informed that this was the cause of failure.

### Robustly and succinctly representing the current game state

Concurrent to the development of our functions, we will figure out the best way to represent all necessary information about the current state in natural language (so that the user/LLM doesn't need to see the GUI).

Here is my current (working) idea (via an example):

```text
CURRENT STATE:

    }
    "special": {

    }

### My (Current Working) Idea For Functions

I am writing this in Python becuase that is what I (and LLMs!) tend to understand best.

```python
from typing import Literal, Optional

Mob = Literal["cow", "skeleton", "zombie", "creeper", "enderman", "..."]
Block = Literal["oak_log", "oak_leaves", "..."]
Item = Literal["diamond_sword", "diamond_pickaxe", "..."]
Structure = Literal["stronghold", "village", "..."]
Biome = Literal["plains", "desert", "..."]
Other = Literal["ravine", "lava_pool", "nether_portal_lit", "nether_portal_unlit", "..."]
Entity = Mob | Block | Structure | Biome | Other

TowardsDirection = Literal["up", "down", "north", "south", "east", "west"]
TowardsCoordinates = tuple[int, int, int]

def travel(
        stop_if_found: Optional[Entity | list[Entity]],
        direction: Optional[TowardsDirection | TowardsCoordinates],
        stay_in: Optional[Structure] = None,
    ):  # Main workhorse for digging, exploring, etc.
    """Travels in the specified direction for a short period of time, stopping if one or
    more of the specified entities is found (i.e., registers as existing either 'in the
    immediate vicinity' or 'beyond the immediate vicinity'). If no direction is specified,
    the function will explore in some direction, trying not to backtrack on previous
    paths.

    Note:
    - The pathfinding will dig if there is not an obvious path.
    - The pathfinding will bridge if it saves time and blocks are available.
    - Since the search time is short, one should expect to use this function many
      times, continually assessing and updating the appropriate direction, before
      encountering a desired entity.

    Usage:
        # Dig down for an increment of time, stopping if a cave is found
        travel(until_found="cave", direction="down")

        # Explore nether fortress for an increment of time, stopping early if a blaze spawner or chest is found
        travel(until_found=["blaze_spawner", "chest"], stay_in="nether_fortress")

        # Travel for an increment of time towards a set of coordinates
        travel(direction=(100, 64, 100))
