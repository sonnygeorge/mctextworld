A semantic wrapper for controlling Minecraft 'Steve'.

## Overview

`semantic-steve` is a Python package that provides a semantically intuitive high-level wrapper for controlling an in-game Minecraft bot.

The primary design goal of `semantic-steve` is as an easy-to-understand, yet _generally capable_ low-level controller for **language-model-driven agent systems**. In pursuit of this goal, `semantic-steve` automates away fast-reflex actions (e.g. reactive self-defense) with classical "game AI" (rule-based decision-making) in order to allow language models to focus on high-level strategic decision-making.
